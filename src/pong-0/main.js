/**
 * Pong-0
 * "The Day-0 Update"
 *
 * Original Lua by: Colton Ogden (cogden@cs50.harvard.edu)
 * Adapted to JS by: Vikram Singh (vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca)
 *
 * Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
 * paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
 * the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.
 *
 * This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
 * the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
 * resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on
 * modern systems.

 * We initialize our game by grabbing the `canvas` element from
 * the DOM located in `index.html` and getting the `context` object
 * from it.

/**
 * This function is the heartbeat of the application. It is called
 * 60 times per second (depending on your monitor's refresh rate) and
 * it is what we will use to drive our game's animations. The way
 * that this function is called 60 times per second is by using JavaScript's
 * `requestAnimationFrame()` API.
 *
 * @param {Number} currentTime How much time has elapsed since the page loaded.

/**
 * This function is called by `gameLoop()` at each frame of program execution;
 * `dt` (i.e., DeltaTime) will be the elapsed time in seconds since the last
 * frame, and we can use this to scale any changes in our game for even behavior
 * across frame rates. This is where the logic of our game will be executed.
 *
 * @param {Number} dt How much time has elapsed since the last time this was called.

 * `update()`. It is called after the update step completes so that we
 * can draw things to the screen once they've changed.
