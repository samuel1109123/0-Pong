/**
 * Pong-3
 * The "Ball" Update
 *
 * Original Lua by: Colton Ogden (cogden@cs50.harvard.edu)
 * Adapted to JS by: Vikram Singh (vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca)
 *
 * Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
 * paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
 * the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.
 *
 * This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
 * the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
 * resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on
 * modern systems.
